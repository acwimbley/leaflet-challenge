# leaflet-challenge
Module 15
This is another assignment that was difficult.  I used alot of what was presented in class.  I choose to illustrate earthquake data for 30 days.  I also decided to add various colors to show the magnitude of the earthquakes.  The colors are:
Yellow <= 3.5
Green <= 4.5
Blue <= 5.5
Darkred >5.5

Console.log showed that the mapping was correct.

I also inserted a heading in the HTML script

I was challenged with the size.
